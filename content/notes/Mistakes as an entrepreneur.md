There are many mistakes an entrepreneur can make, too many to count. I want to share one of those mistakes I've made: Working too much.

What I mean by that is that I focused on the wrong things. Working as an employee although I should've worked as an employer and as an entrepreneur. The issue lies with the distinction of when to focus on leadership and management tasks and when to focus on the operations and project tasks. As an developer growing into a leader I was in charge of multiple aspects of the company, thus interfering with the focus of being an entrepreneur.

Lessons:
- The company needs leadership, someone has to step down from the client projects to lead, sell, organize and push forward.
- Juggling multiple roles through different projects is inefficient - as you'd be spreading yourself too thin, thus nothing gets really done properly.
